# Tetris Clone Using Pygame

![Tetris gif](/tetris.gif)

Welcome to my Tetris clone project! This project is built using Python and the Pygame library. Below, you'll find detailed information about the features and credits for this project.

## Features

### Inheritance

The project utilizes inheritance in `display_component.py` to manage game components efficiently. This is an enhancement from the original code and allows for better code organization and reusability.

### Next Tetromino Display

The game is designed to display only the next tetromino, similar to the classic Tetris game. This feature adds a strategic element to the gameplay, allowing players to plan their moves ahead of time.

### Color Palette

A Tetris-inspired color palette has been implemented to give the game a nostalgic feel. The colors are carefully chosen to resemble the original Tetris game, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alanjameschapman/tetris.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd tetris
    ```
3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Run the game**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## How to Play

**Controls**:

- Use the arrow keys to move the tetrominoes.
- Use the up key to rotate the tetrominoes.
- Use the down key to speed up the fall of the tetrominoes.

**Objective**: The goal is to clear as many lines as possible by fitting the tetrominoes together. The game ends when the tetrominoes stack up to the top of the playing field.
