# Tetris Clone Using Pygame

Welcome to my Tetris clone project! This project is built using Python and the Pygame library. Below, you'll find detailed information about the features and credits for this project.

## Features

### Inheritance

- **Inheritance**: The project utilizes inheritance in `display_component.py` to manage game components efficiently. This approach allows for better code organization and reusability.

### Next Tetromino Display

- **Next Tetromino Display**: The game is designed to display only the next tetromino, similar to the classic Tetris game. This feature adds a strategic element to the gameplay, allowing players to plan their moves ahead of time.

### Color Palette

- **Color Palette**: A Tetris-inspired color palette has been implemented to give the game a nostalgic feel. The colors are carefully chosen to resemble the original Tetris game, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alanjameschapman/tetris.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd tetris
    ```
3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Run the game**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## How to Play

- **Controls**:
    - Use the arrow keys to move the tetrominoes.
    - Use the up key to rotate the tetrominoes.
    - Use the down key to speed up the fall of the tetrominoes.

- **Objective**: The goal is to clear as many lines as possible by fitting the tetrominoes together. The game ends when the tetrominoes stack up to the top of the playing field.
